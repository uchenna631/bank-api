# **Containerization Plan**
## **Goal**
Setup Dockerfiles for the project to run inside of containers. Do not set up docker-compose for running locally as it is not required.

## **List of services to be containerized**
-  (/home/uchenna/spring-boot-mongo/bank-api)
  - Language: Java (Spring Boot)
  - Entrypoint: bank-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  - Dependencies: Maven, Java 17, Spring Boot, MongoDB

## **Execution Step**
> **Below are the steps for Copilot to follow; ask Copilot to update or execute this plan.**
Steps to containerize the project:
1. Check containerization pre-requisites:
    1. Ensure Docker is installed and running.
2. Scan the repository using tool 'appmod-analyze-repository'.
3. Check code is ready to run in a local container:
    1. Ensure the application reads configuration from environment variables. Avoid hardcoding configuration values.
    2. Review the application's dependencies that must be hosted in the cloud, and list these for the user.
4. Create a Dockerfile for each project:
    1. Use tool 'appmod-plan-generate-dockerfile' to generate the Dockerfile.
5. Build the Docker images for each project:
    1. Use docker build command to build the Docker images (do not run). Tag the images with the proper version.
6. Summarize the successful containerization:
    1. List out the dockerfiles created for each project.
    2. Describe to the user the code edits required to successfully containerize the project.
